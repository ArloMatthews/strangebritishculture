<p style="color:white">British culture finds its home in the country of England, which is obvious to most. Although many people don’t associate England as a wealth of culture, they have many odd customs that have been present throughout history. To understand British culture, we must first look at this history and general information to see how Britain got to this place in its existence. England is erroneously considered synonymous with the title of Great Britain in many cases, as it also encompasses the areas of Scotland and Wales in addition to England. Because of this association though, we’re going to be concentrating on the unique facets of this culture in England.</p>

<p style="color:white">Evidence of people living in England goes back as far as 800,000 years ago with the discovery of ancient tools from the era. In AD 43 the area was notably conquered by the Roman Empire, who maintained control of it until the 5th century. Afer their rule was displaced we start to see the emergence of the English people and culture that would eventually shape into the one that we know today with the Anglo-Saxon settlement. It was around this time that the Old English language came into prominence. After a series of wars and takeovers, England became the colonialist power that we know it as in the last couple centuries. England expanded and took over many regions of the world, as well as playing a huge part in the discovery of American land. A monarchy became the primary system of government, which eventually took a backseat to the Parliament governing body that is in charge of the country now. The country was a huge part of the Industrial revolution and became a world power, before losing a lot of its land and power over the course of the two world wars in the 20th century. </p>

<p style="color:white">Because of this backlog of events in history and its interaction with the rest of the world, England serves as a hub of knowledge and culture as well as the foundations of other country’s cultures as well. England is home to some of the greatest collections of art in the world at the British Museum, the most impressive architectural feats, as well as distinctly different styles of literature, television, and movies. And while many of these are pioneering and great examples of British culture, some are a bit less flattering and frankly, unusual.</p>
