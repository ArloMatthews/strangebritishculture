<body>
<p style="color:white">Several sports that have gone on to be played worldwide originally came from England. Football, or “soccer” as we call it in the United States, is possibly the most popular of these, famously originating from the country in the 1800s. Other sports that may be familiar include tennis, rugby, badminton, golf, baseball, hockey, and cricket (which some view as a variation of baseball). England is also huge for the pub and viewing culture that surrounds these sports, creating an event out of watching the game both at the location it’s happening and on television screens in public spaces. But for all the sports and activities that were shared with the world, there are some odd ones that never really took off. These may only occur in certain parts of the country or at certain times of the year, but still seem a bit zany to anyone who wasn’t raised to see these competitions as normal.</p>

	<center><img src="cheeserolling.jpg" alt="Cheese Rolling" style="width:50%"></center>
</figure>
<p style="color:white">This event is one of the most popular and discussed in the realm of strange British traditions. It takes place every year and is a primal, yet entertaining way of racing. A round of Double Gloucester cheese is tossed down a great hill in Gloucestershire and everyone in the race has to chase after it. Because the hill is so large, the cheese has gathered speeds of up to 70 miles per hour (not putting that into kilometers). Whoever crosses the finish line first has to perform a shirtless spring back up the hill with the trophy. Even though the event has a ridiculous premise, there have been incidents of injuries and fierce battles on the way down the hill in the past. </p>

	<figcaption style="text-align: center; color:white"><b>Pancake Flipping Race</b></figcaption>
	<center><img src="pancakeflipping.jpg" alt="Pancake Flipping" style="width:50%"></center>
</figure>
<p style="color:white">The holiday aligns with the time of Mardi Gras celebration in the United States and other countries, but is obviously a very different type of event. As if flipping pancakes wasn't hard enough on its own, the race element makes you concentrate extra hard on keeping the pancake inside the pan. Weirdly enough, this tradition is also celebrated in Kansas where they compete against the English town. The tradition supposedly has its origins of enjoying pancakes before avoiding them for lent.</p>

	<figcaption style="text-align: center; color:white"><b>Nettle Eating Championship</b></figcaption>
	<center><img src="nettleeating.jpg" alt="Nettle Eating" style="width:50%"></center>
</figure>
<p style="color:white">Unlike the other competitions on this site that involve food, this competition actually involves eating the food as part of the event. What started as an argument between two farmers about how had taller nettle stalks eventually turned into this competition. Competitors have an hour to eat as many of nettle leaves as they can inside a pub, which can be challenging given their "zing" that is part of what makes it a "stinging" nettle plant.</p>

	<figcaption style="text-align: center; color:white"><b>Hurling the Silver Ball</b></figcaption>
	<center><img src="silverball.jpg" alt="Hurling the Silver Ball" style="width:50%"></center>
</figure>
<p style="color:white">This event takes places in Cornwall and isn't necessarily that complicated. The objective is to throw a small silver ball across the boundary of parish and into goals that are set up a couple miles apart. Whoever wins the game is carried to the market square and the ball gets dipped in jugs of beer for good luck. The event isn't as much of a race as it about endurance and last stamina given the journey. </p>

	<figcaption style="text-align: center; color:white"><b>The Wife Carrying Race</b></figcaption>
	<center><img src="wifecarrying.jpg" alt="Wife Carrying" style="width:50%"></center>
</figure>
<p style="color:white">This event may be the trickiest on this page yet, as it requires both feats of strength and endurance. It fits the parameters of a normal race but this time the competitors have to carry their partners along a 380 mile course. According to the Condé Nest Traveller, the conditions for the race are as follows: "Wives must weigh at least 50kg - and those lacking in kilos must make up the weight in the equivalent of baked bean cans - and must wear a helmet; and competitors must complete the course (beset by hay-bale hurdles and the occasional cold-water hazard)." But the challenge is worth the reward, as prizes are offered for several of the competitors. The winner gets £100 and a barrel of ale, while the losers receive dog food. There is an additional prize of a pound of sausage for whoever carries the heaviest wife on their back. As you can see by the picture provided, the actual technique for the carrying differs from team to team.</p>

	<figcaption style="text-align: center; color:white"><b>Bog Snorkeling Championships</b></figcaption>
	<center><img src="bogsnorkeling.jpg" alt="Bog Snorkeling" style="width:50%"></center>
</figure>
<p style="color:white">Competitors have to complete a 60cm swim along a trench in a beat bog. It's much shallower, murkier than you would traditionally use for snorkeling, so the challenge is that you have to use the snorkel and the flippers that are standard with the activity. You cannot use any type of traditional swimming strokes to complete the event. The event has been going strong since the mid-70s and takes place every August.</p>
<figure>
	<figcaption style="text-align: center; color:white"><b>Tar Barrel Racing</b></figcaption>
	<center><img src="tarbarrelracing.jpg" alt="Tar Barrel Racing" style="width:50%"></center>
</figure>
<p style="color:white">Tar Barrel Racing is different from the rest of the events here due to the fact that it is still very much illegal and extremely dangerous. Whereas casual participation is encouraged in many other competitions here, this one is not for the weak. The objective is to get as close as you can to a barrel that has been filled with tar and lit of fire as it is ran through the streets. And yes, it's valid to say that you lose if burning tar gets splashed on you. It's not like a normal race in the way that there is really no parameters for the event.</p>
<figure>
	<figcaption style="text-align: center; color:white"><b>Gurning Championships</b></figcaption>
	<center><img src="gurningchampionships.jpg" alt="Gurning Championships" style="width:50%"></center>
</figure>
<p style="color:white">This last event might be the goofiest of them all, which is really something considering the others that take place. Quite simply, this competition is a funny face contest. Whoever makes the most laughable expression is the victor here. The compeition takes place at the Egremont Crab Fair in Cumbria, which has been going on since 1267.</p>
